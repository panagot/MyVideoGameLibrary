## 🎯 PHASE 1: MVP Launch (Next 0-3 months)

### Priority 1: Core Infrastructure (Critical for Launch)

#### 1.1 User Authentication System ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
**Status**: Not implemented  
**What's needed**:
- Google OAuth login
- Discord OAuth login  
- Steam OAuth login (optional but valuable)
- User session management
- Protected routes

**Why first**: Can't launch without real users. This is the foundation.

**Tech options**:
- **Quick win**: Firebase Auth (Google + Discord ready, free tier)
- **Better long-term**: Supabase (auth + database in one)
- **Custom**: Auth0 or Clerk

**Estimated time**: 2-3 days

---

#### 1.2 Backend Database ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
**Status**: Currently using mock data  
**What's needed**:
- Replace `mockData.js` with real database
- User accounts storage
- Collections storage (games, consoles)
- Trade requests storage
- Activity feed storage

**Tech options**:
- **Fastest**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, real-time, includes auth)
- **Alternative**: Firebase Firestore
- **Custom**: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL (more control, more work)

**Estimated time**: 3-5 days

---

#### 1.3 Trade Request System
**Status**: UI exists (`TradeModal.jsx`), but no backend  
**What's needed**:
- Save trade requests to database
- Notification system (when trade requested)
- Trade request page/inbox
- Accept/decline functionality
- Basic in-app messaging (or email notifications)

**Estimated time**: 2-3 days

---

### Priority 2: Trust & Safety (Build Confidence)

#### 2.1 Verified Badge System
**Status**: Not implemented  
**What's needed**:
- Manual verification (admin grants verified badge)
- Show verified badge on profiles
- Verified traders get priority in marketplace

**Estimated time**: 1-2 days

---

#### 2.2 User Ratings/Reviews
**Status**: Not implemented  
**What's needed**:
- Rate users after completed trades
- Show rating on profile
- Trust score calculation

**Estimated time**: 2-3 days

---

### Priority 3: Enhanced Features

#### 3.1 Real-Time Activity Feed
**Status**: Static data  
**What's needed**:
- Real-time updates using WebSockets or Supabase real-time
- Show actual user activities as they happen

**Estimated time**: 1-2 days

---

#### 3.2 Profile Customization
**Status**: Basic profiles exist  
**What's needed**:
- Custom profile banners
- Bio editing
- Social links (YouTube, Twitter, etc.)
- Collection showcase (featured games)

**Estimated time**: 2-3 days
